Moreover, we suggest a corrected\ntime-dependent density matrix renormalization group algorithm that ensures the\nconservation of the expectation value of the number of particles when a GVW or\na MPS are not explicitly number-conserving. The GVW dynamics obtained with our\nalgorithm compares very well with the exact one in 1D. Most importantly, the\nalgorithm works in any dimension for a GVW.

    "abstract": "Several logical qubits and quantum gates have been proposed for semiconductor\nquantum dots controlled by voltages applied to top gates. Differences between\nthe schemes can make it difficult to compare them meaningfully. Here we develop\na theoretical framework to evaluate disparate qubit-gating schemes on an equal\nfooting. We apply the procedure to two types of double-dot qubits: the\nsinglet-triplet (ST) and the semiconducting quantum dot hybrid qubit. We\ninvestigate three quantum gates that flip the qubit state: a DC pulsed gate, an\nAC gate based on logical qubit resonance (LQR), and a gate-like process known\nas stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP). These gates are all mediated by\nan exchange interaction that depends on a small number of experimental control\nparameters, including the interdot tunnel coupling $g$ and the detuning\n$\\epsilon$, which sets the energy difference between the dots. Our procedure\nhas two steps. First, we optimize the gate fidelity ($f$) for fixed $g$ as a\nfunction of the other control parameters; this yields an $f^\\text{opt}(g)$ that\nis universal for different types of gates. Next, we identify physical\nconstraints on the control parameters; this yields an upper bound\n$f^\\text{max}$ that is specific to the qubit-gate combination. We show that\nsimilar gate fidelities ($\\sim 99.5$%) should be attainable for ST qubits in\nisotopically purified Si, and for hybrid qubits in natural Si.

The new argument shows precisely why quantization makes a\ndifference, and why time-symmetry alone does not imply retrocausality, in the\nclassical context. It is true that later developments in quantum theory provide\na way to avoid retrocausality, without violating time-symmetry; but this escape\nroute relies on the \"ontic\" conception of the wave function that Einstein\nrejected. Had this new argument been noticed much sooner, then, it seems likely\nthat retrocausality would have been regarded as the default option for hidden\nvariables theories (a fact that would then have seemed confirmed by Bell's\nTheorem and the No Hidden Variable theorems). This paper presents these ideas\nat a level intended to be accessible to general readers.",

We propose a general approach based on\nnon-Markovian dynamical maps to extract this information from the initial\ntrajectories and compress it into non-Markovian transfer tensors. Assuming\ntime-translational invariance, the tensors can be used to accurately and\nefficiently propagate the state of the system to arbitrarily long timescales.\nThe non-Markovian Transfer Tensor Method (TTM) demonstrates the\ncoherent-to-incoherent transition as a function of the strength of quantum\ndissipation and predicts the non-canonical equilibrium distribution due to the\nsystem-bath entanglement. TTM is equivalent to solving the Nakajima-Zwanzig\nequation, and therefore can be used to reconstruct the dynamical operators (the\nsystem Hamiltonian and memory kernel) from quantum trajectories obtained in\nsimulations or experiments. The concept underlying the approach can be\ngeneralized to physical observables with the goal of learning and manipulating\nthe trajectories of an open quantum system.",

In all cases, the\nscaling exhibits an oscillatory behavior that terminates at the factorization\npoint and whose frequency is universal. Parity effects in the scaling of the\nR\\'enyi entropies for gapless models at zero field are thus shown to be a\nparticular case of such universal behavior. Likewise, the absence of\noscillations for the Ising chain in transverse field is due to the vanishing\nvalue of the factorizing field for this particular model. In general, the\ntransition occurring at the factorizing field between two different scaling\nregimes of the entanglement spectrum corresponds to a quantum transition to the\nformation of finite-range, ordered structures of quasi-dimers, quasi-trimers,\nand quasi-polymers. This entanglement-driven transition is superimposed to and\nindependent of the long-range magnetic order in the broken symmetry phase.\nTherefore, it conforms to recent generalizations that identify and classify the\nquantum phases of matter according to the structure of ground-state\nentanglement patterns. We characterize this form of quantum order by a global\norder parameter of entanglement defined as the integral, over blocks of all\nlengths, of the R\\'enyi entropy of infinite order. Equivalently, it can be\ndefined as the integral of the bipartite single-copy or geometric entanglement.\nThe global entanglement order parameter remains always finite at fields below\nthe factorization point and vanishes identically above it.",

With a\nnoiseless linear amplifier it is possible to perform tasks such as improving\nthe performance of quantum key distribution and purifying lossy channels.\nPrevious designs for noiseless linear amplifiers involving linear optics and\nphoton counting are non-optimal because they have a probability of success\nlower than the theoretical bound given by the theory of generalised quantum\nmeasurement. This paper develops a theoretical model which reaches this limit.\nWe calculate the fidelity and probability of success of this new model for\ncoherent states and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) entangled states.",

Quantum metrology has been so\nfar successfully applied to design precision instruments such as clocks and\nsensors which outperform classical devices by exploiting quantum properties.\nThere are advanced plans to implement these and other quantum technologies in\nspace, for instance Space-QUEST and Space Optical Clock projects intend to\nimplement quantum communications and quantum clocks at regimes where relativity\nstarts to kick in. However, typical setups do not take into account the effects\nof relativity on quantum properties. To include and exploit these effects, we\nintroduce techniques for the application of metrology to quantum field theory\n(QFT). QFT properly incorporates quantum theory and relativity, in particular,\nat regimes where space-based experiments take place. This framework allows for\nhigh precision estimation of parameters that appear in QFT including proper\ntimes and accelerations. Indeed, the techniques can be applied to develop a\nnovel generation of relativistic quantum technologies for gravimeters, clocks\nand sensors. As an example, we present a high precision device which improves\nthe state-of-the-art in quantum accelerometers by exploiting relativistic\neffects.",

We derive a general expression for the output states in\nthe Fock basis and implement a numerical procedure to calculate the Holevo\nquantity. Using asymptotic properties of Toeplitz matrices, we present an\nanalytic expression for the Holevo quantity valid for very weak signals and\nsufficiently strong dephasing when the dominant contribution comes from the\nsingle-photon sector in the Hilbert space of signal states. Based on numerical\nresults we conjecture an inequality for contributions to the Holevo quantity\nfrom multiphoton sectors which implies that in the limit of low average photon\nnumber the channel capacity for arbitrarily weak dephasing scales linearly with\nthe average number of photons contained in the pulse. Such behaviour presents a\nqualitative departure from the fully coherent scheme.",
