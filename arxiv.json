As a kind of quantum correlation, it is expected that\nbipartite nonlocaity should be present in quantum systems, just as bipartite\nentanglement does. Surprisingly, for various models, two-qubit states do not\nviolate Bell inequalities, i.e., they are local. Recently, it is realized that\nthe results are related to the monogamy trade-off obeyed by bipartite Bell\ncorrelations, thus it is believed that for general translation invariant\nsystems, two-qubit states should not violate the Bell inequality(Oliveira, EPL\n100, 60004 (2012)). In this report, we will demonstrate that in perfect\ntranslation invariant systems, the Bell inequality can be violated. A\nnontrivial model is constructed to confirm the conclusion.\n",

We apply the procedure to two types of double-dot qubits: the\nsinglet-triplet (ST) and the semiconducting quantum dot hybrid qubit. We\ninvestigate three quantum gates that flip the qubit state: a DC pulsed gate, an\nAC gate based on logical qubit resonance (LQR), and a gate-like process known\nas stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP). These gates are all mediated by\nan exchange interaction that depends on a small number of experimental control\nparameters, including the interdot tunnel coupling $g$ and the detuning\n$\\epsilon$, which sets the energy difference between the dots. Our procedure\nhas two steps. First, we optimize the gate fidelity ($f$) for fixed $g$ as a\nfunction of the other control parameters; this yields an $f^\\text{opt}(g)$ that\nis universal for different types of gates. Next, we identify physical\nconstraints on the control parameters; this yields an upper bound\n$f^\\text{max}$ that is specific to the qubit-gate combination. We show that\nsimilar gate fidelities ($\\sim 99.5$%) should be attainable for ST qubits in\nisotopically purified Si, and for hybrid qubits in natural Si. Considerably\nlower fidelities are obtained for GaAs devices, due to the fluctuating magnetic\nfields $\\Delta B$ produced by nuclear spins.",

Parity effects in the scaling of the\nR\\'enyi entropies for gapless models at zero field are thus shown to be a\nparticular case of such universal behavior. Likewise, the absence of\noscillations for the Ising chain in transverse field is due to the vanishing\nvalue of the factorizing field for this particular model. In general, the\ntransition occurring at the factorizing field between two different scaling\nregimes of the entanglement spectrum corresponds to a quantum transition to the\nformation of finite-range, ordered structures of quasi-dimers, quasi-trimers,\nand quasi-polymers. This entanglement-driven transition is superimposed to and\nindependent of the long-range magnetic order in the broken symmetry phase.\nTherefore, it conforms to recent generalizations that identify and classify the\nquantum phases of matter according to the structure of ground-state\nentanglement patterns.

We show that in case of two wells, our model corresponds\nexactly to the latest improvement of the two-mode model. We derive a formula\nfor the self-trapping period, which turns out to be chiefly ruled by the\non-site interaction energy parameter. By comparing to time dependent\nGross-Pitaevskii simulations, we show that the multimode model results can be\nenhanced in a remarkable way over all the regimes by only renormalizing such a\nparameter. Finally, using a different approach which involves only the ground\nstate density, we derive an effective interaction energy parameter that shows\nto be in accordance with the renormalized one.",

An exact analytical expression of quantum Fisher\ninformation is derived to show the role of photon losses on the ultimate phase\nsensitivity. We find a transition of the sensitivity from the Heisenberg\nscaling to the classical scaling due to quantum decoherence of the photon\nstate. This quantum-classical transition is uniquely determined by the number\nof photons being lost, instead of the number of incident photons or the photon\nloss rate alone. Our results also reveal that a crossover of the sensitivity\nbetween the entangled coherent state and the NOON state can occur even for very\nsmall photon loss rate.",

The resulting correspondence of nodes across networks,\nalso called node alignment, can be used to identify invariant subgraphs across\nthe input graphs.\n  Given $k$ graphs as input, alignment algorithms use topological information\nto assign a similarity score to each $k$-tuple of nodes, with elements (nodes)\ndrawn from each of the input graphs. Nodes are considered similar if their\nneighbors are also similar. An alternate, equivalent view of these network\nalignment algorithms is to consider the Kronecker product of the input graphs,\nand to identify high-ranked nodes in the Kronecker product graph. Conventional\nmethods such as PageRank and HITS (Hypertext Induced Topic Selection) can be\nused for this purpose. These methods typically require computation of the\nprincipal eigenvector of a suitably modified Kronecker product matrix of the\ninput graphs. We adopt this alternate view of the problem to address the\nproblem of multiple network alignment.
