Two-qubits integrated logic gates as well as complex\ninterferometric structures have been successfully demonstrated exploiting\npolarization encoding in femtosecond-laser-written photonic circuits. Still,\nintegrated devices performing single-qubit rotations are missing. Here we\ndemonstrate waveguide-based waveplates, fabricated by femtosecond laser pulses,\ncapable to effectively produce arbitrary single-qubit operations in the\npolarization encoding. By exploiting these novel components we fabricate and\ntest a compact device for the quantum state tomography of two\npolarization-entangled photons. The integrated optical waveplates complete the\ntoolbox required for a full manipulation of polarization-encoded qubits\non-chip, disclosing new scenarios for integrated quantum computation, sensing\nand simulation, and possibly finding application also in standard photonic\ndevices.",
