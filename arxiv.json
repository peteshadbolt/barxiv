Differences between\nthe schemes can make it difficult to compare them meaningfully. Here we develop\na theoretical framework to evaluate disparate qubit-gating schemes on an equal\nfooting. We apply the procedure to two types of double-dot qubits: the\nsinglet-triplet (ST) and the semiconducting quantum dot hybrid qubit. We\ninvestigate three quantum gates that flip the qubit state: a DC pulsed gate, an\nAC gate based on logical qubit resonance (LQR), and a gate-like process known\nas stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP). These gates are all mediated by\nan exchange interaction that depends on a small number of experimental control\nparameters, including the interdot tunnel coupling $g$ and the detuning\n$\\epsilon$, which sets the energy difference between the dots. Our procedure\nhas two steps. First, we optimize the gate fidelity ($f$) for fixed $g$ as a\nfunction of the other control parameters; this yields an $f^\\text{opt}(g)$ that\nis universal for different types of gates. Next, we identify physical\nconstraints on the control parameters; this yields an upper bound\n$f^\\text{max}$ that is specific to the qubit-gate combination. We show that\nsimilar gate fidelities ($\\sim 99.5$%) should be attainable for ST qubits in\nisotopically purified Si, and for hybrid qubits in natural Si.

Here we present a\nsimple architecture for boson-sampling based on multiplexed parameteric\ndown-conversion and demonstrate that the architecture is limited only by the\npost-selected detection efficiency.

Whereas the question has been studied quite extensively\nfor bipartite correlations (yielding both pessimistic and optimistic results),\nonly little is known in the multi-partite case. We introduce a general\nframework of reductions between multi-party input-output systems.

It is true that later developments in quantum theory provide\na way to avoid retrocausality, without violating time-symmetry; but this escape\nroute relies on the \"ontic\" conception of the wave function that Einstein\nrejected.

In all cases, the\nscaling exhibits an oscillatory behavior that terminates at the factorization\npoint and whose frequency is universal. Parity effects in the scaling of the\nR\\'enyi entropies for gapless models at zero field are thus shown to be a\nparticular case of such universal behavior. Likewise, the absence of\noscillations for the Ising chain in transverse field is due to the vanishing\nvalue of the factorizing field for this particular model. In general, the\ntransition occurring at the factorizing field between two different scaling\nregimes of the entanglement spectrum corresponds to a quantum transition to the\nformation of finite-range, ordered structures of quasi-dimers, quasi-trimers,\nand quasi-polymers. This entanglement-driven transition is superimposed to and\nindependent of the long-range magnetic order in the broken symmetry phase.\nTherefore, it conforms to recent generalizations that identify and classify the\nquantum phases of matter according to the structure of ground-state\nentanglement patterns. We characterize this form of quantum order by a global\norder parameter of entanglement defined as the integral, over blocks of all\nlengths, of the R\\'enyi entropy of infinite order.

In this paper, we systematically analyze a\nnormalized form of the nonlinear Schrodinger system with two new families of\nPT-symmetric potentials in the presence of competing nonlinearities. We\ngenerate a class of localized eigenmodes and carry out a linear stability\nanalysis on the solutions.

    "abstract": "Comparative analyses of graph structured datasets underly diverse problems.\nExamples of these problems include identification of conserved functional\ncomponents (biochemical interactions) across species, structural similarity of\nlarge biomolecules, and recurring patterns of interactions in social networks.\nA large class of such analyses methods quantify the topological similarity of\nnodes across networks. The resulting correspondence of nodes across networks,\nalso called node alignment, can be used to identify invariant subgraphs across\nthe input graphs.\n  Given $k$ graphs as input, alignment algorithms use topological information\nto assign a similarity score to each $k$-tuple of nodes, with elements (nodes)\ndrawn from each of the input graphs. Nodes are considered similar if their\nneighbors are also similar. An alternate, equivalent view of these network\nalignment algorithms is to consider the Kronecker product of the input graphs,\nand to identify high-ranked nodes in the Kronecker product graph. Conventional\nmethods such as PageRank and HITS (Hypertext Induced Topic Selection) can be\nused for this purpose. These methods typically require computation of the\nprincipal eigenvector of a suitably modified Kronecker product matrix of the\ninput graphs. We adopt this alternate view of the problem to address the\nproblem of multiple network alignment. Using the phase estimation algorithm, we\nshow that the multiple network alignment problem can be efficiently solved on\nquantum computers. We characterize the accuracy and performance of our method,\nand show that it can deliver exponential speedups over conventional\n(non-quantum) methods.",

However, in the theory proposed\nby Compton and subsequent refinements, the medium features in explicit form are\nnot generally accounted at all. This theory is based on the relationship\nbetween the photon momentum and its energy that may take place only in vacuum,\nbut not in a medium with non-unity refractive index n. Here, we use Abraham's\nrepresentation for the momentum of a photon in medium for the creation of a new\nconsistent Compton effect theory accounting for media features. A new condition\nunder which anomalous Compton effect is possible, is defined. In our case, due\nto the photon scattering on a moving electron, the photon's energy can increase\nwhen the electron velocity is above a threshold value, in analogy with the\nVavilov-Cherenkov radiation effect. In our theory we also provide a new\ndescription of the parameters for scattered electrons, which is important for\nthe experimental determination of the dependence of the Compton effect in\nmedium on refractive index n.",
