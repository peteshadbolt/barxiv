We begin by completing the \\emph{perfect}\ndistinguishability problem of two-qubit ensembles - both for separable\noperations and LOCC - by providing necessary and sufficient conditions for the\nperfect discrimination of one pure and one mixed state. Then for the well-known\ntask of minimum error discrimination, it is shown that \\textit{almost all}\ntwo-qubit ensembles consisting of three pure states cannot be optimally\ndiscriminated using LOCC. This is surprising considering that \\textit{any} two\npure states can be distinguished optimally by LOCC. Special attention is given\nto ensembles that lack entanglement, and we prove an easy sufficient condition\nfor when a set of three product states cannot be optimally distinguished by\nLOCC, thus providing new examples of the phenomenon known as \"non-locality\nwithout entanglement\". We next consider an example of $N$ parties who each\nshare the same state but who are ignorant of its identity. The state is drawn\nfrom the rotationally invariant \"trine ensemble\", and we establish a tight\nconnection between the $N$-copy ensemble and Shor's \"lifted\" single-copy\nensemble. For any finite $N$, we prove that optimal identification of the\nstates cannot be achieved by LOCC; however as $N\\to\\infty$, LOCC can indeed\ndiscriminate the states optimally. This is the first result of its kind.\nFinally, we turn to the task of unambiguous discrimination and derive new lower\nbounds on the LOCC inconclusive probability for symmetric states. When applied\nto the double trine ensemble, this leads to a rather different\ndistinguishability character than when the minimum-error probability is\nconsidered.\n",

    "abstract": "To acquire knowledge about nature we need to observe its constituents. In\nquantum mechanics, observing is not a passive act. Consider a system of two\nquantum particles A and B: if a measurement apparatus M is used to make an\nobservation on particle B, then the overall state of the system AB will\ntypically be altered. When this happens no matter which local measurement is\nperformed, the two objects A and B are revealed to possess peculiar\ncorrelations known as quantum discord. Here we demonstrate that the very act of\nlocal observation gives rise to an \"activation protocol\" which converts discord\ninto distillable entanglement, a stronger and more useful form of quantum\ncorrelations, between the apparatus M and the composite system AB. In order to\nexperimentally implement such activation protocol, we adopt a flexible\ntwo-photon setup to realize a three-qubit system (A,B,M) with programmable\ndegrees of initial correlations, measurement interaction, and characterization\nprocesses. Our experiment demonstrates the fundamental mechanism underpinning\nthe ubiquitous act of observing the quantum world, and unlocks the potential of\ndiscord for entanglement generation, a primitive for quantum technology.\n",

In SDC, Alice sends two classical dits of information to Bob by sending\na single qudit. While it is well known that preshared entanglement is necessary\nto achieve a quantum advantage in SDC (i.e., to send more than one dit per\nqudit), we find that complementarity is also necessary in the sense that the\nlocal unitaries Alice applies to her system must be non-commuting. Our main\nresult shows that complementarity is also \\textit{sufficient} to achieve a\nquantum advantage, when the preshared state is maximally entangled. More\nprecisely, when Alice encodes her messages with products of Pauli operators for\nobservables with non-zero complementarity then she can send Bob greater than\none dit per qudit, and if the observables have nearly perfect complementarity\nthen she can send nearly two dits per qudit. Our bound on the SDC capacity has\na striking resemblance to uncertainty relations, and we also generalise our\n\"uncertainty relation\" to the case where the channel from Alice to Bob is\nnoisy, and the preshared state is arbitrary.

The\nT-sampling stabilization problem is introduced and solved: given any initial\ncondition X(0) any goal state Xg find a feedback law such that X(jT) converges\nto Xg as the integer j tends to infinity. The purpose is to generate arbitrary\nquantum gates corresponding to Xg. This is achieved by the tracking of\nT-periodic reference trajectories that pass by Xg using the framework of\nCoron's Return Method. The T-periodic reference trajectories are generated by\napplying open-loop controls that are a sum of a finite number M of odd\nT-periodic function whose amplitudes are parameterized by a vector. The main\nresult establishes that, for M big enough, X(jT) exponentially converges\ntowards Xg for almost all fixed amplitude vectors, with explicit and completely\nconstructive control laws. This paper also establishes a stochastic version of\nthis deterministic control law. The key idea is to randomly choose a different\namplitude vector at each sampling time jT, and keeping it fixed until the next\nsampling time (j+1)T. It is also shown that X(jT) exponentially converges\ntowards Xg almost surely. Simulation results have indicated that the\nconvergence speed may be significantly improved with such stochastic technique.\nThis is illustrated in the generation of the C--NOT quantum logic gate on U(4).",

It is currently unavailable, which makes it impossible to\nreach the real performance of a two-way CVQKD system. The reconciliation\nprocess of correlated Gaussian variables is a complex problem that requires\neither tomography in the physical layer that is intractable in a practical\nscenario, or high-cost calculations in the multidimensional spherical space\nwith strict dimensional limitations. To avoid these issues, we propose an\nefficient logical layer-based reconciliation method for two-way CVQKD to\nextract binary information from correlated Gaussian variables. We demonstrate\nthat by operating on the raw-data level, the noise of the quantum channel can\nbe corrected in the scalar space and the reconciliation can be extended to\narbitrary high dimensions. We prove that the error probability of scalar\nreconciliation is zero in any practical CVQKD scenario, and provides\nunconditional security. The results allow to significantly improve the\ncurrently available key rates and transmission distances of two-way CVQKD.

Kaushal\nand O. Smirnova, Phys. Rev. A 88, 013421 (2013)]. The approach is fully quantum\nbut includes the concept of trajectories. However, the trajectories are not\nclassical in the sense that they have both real and imaginary components all\nthe way to the detector. We show that the imaginary parts of these\ntrajectories, which are usually ignored, have a clear physical meaning and are\ncrucial for the correct description of electron-core interactions after\nionization. In particular, they give rise to electron deceleration, as well as\ndynamics associated with electron recapture and release. Our approach is\nanalytical and time-dependent, and allows one to gain access to the electron\nenergy distribution and ionization yield as a function of time. Thus we can\nalso rigorously answer the question: when is ionization completed?",

As a result, changes in quantum coherence can lead\nto a heat flow with no associated temperature, and affect the entropy\nproduction rate.

These ambiguities are associated to choices of an integration\ncontour in the resummation of perturbation theory, along (singular) Stokes\ndirections in the complex Borel plane (rendering perturbative expansions\nnon-Borel summable along any Stokes line). More recently, it has been shown\nthat the proper framework to address these issues is that of resurgent analysis\nand transseries. In this context, the cancelation of all nonperturbative\nambiguities is shown to be a consequence of choosing the transseries median\nresummation as the appropriate family of unambiguous real solutions along the\ncoupling-constant real axis. While the median resummation is easily implemented\nfor one-parameter transseries, once one considers more general multi-parameter\ntransseries the procedure becomes highly dependent upon properly understanding\nStokes transitions in the complex Borel plane. In particular, all Stokes\ncoefficients must now be known in order to explicitly implement multi-parameter\nmedian resummations. In the cases where quantum-theoretical physical\nobservables are described by resurgent functions and transseries, the methods\ndescribed herein show how one may cancel nonperturbative ambiguities, and\ndefine these observables nonperturbatively starting out from perturbation\ntheory.

The evolution of a wave function with $N$\ntime variables is governed by $N$ Schr\\\"odinger equations, one for each time\nvariable. These Schr\\\"odinger equations can be inconsistent with each other,\ni.e., they can fail to possess a joint solution for every initial condition; in\nfact, the $N$ Hamiltonians need to satisfy a certain commutator condition in\norder to be consistent. While this condition is automatically satisfied for\nnon-interacting particles, it is a challenge to set up consistent multi-time\nequations with interaction. We prove for a wide class of multi-time\nSchr\\\"odinger equations that the presence of interaction potentials leads to\ninconsistency.

We find that the well-known method for locally increasing\nentanglement, phonon subtraction, may not result in entanglement gain when\nlosses are taken into account. Thus, we investigate the critical number m_c of\nphonon subtraction attempts from the matter modes of the quantum memory. If the\ninitial state is not de-Gaussified within m_c attempts, the protocol should be\nrestarted to obtain any entanglement increase. Moreover, the condition m_c>1\nimplies an additional constraint on the subtraction beam splitter interaction\ntransmissivity, viz. it should be about 50% for a wide range of protocol\nparameters. Additionally, we consider the average entanglement rate, which\ntakes into account both the unavoidable probabilistic nature of the protocol\nand its possible failure as a result of a large number of unsuccessful\nsubtraction attempts. We find that a higher value of the average entanglement\ncan be achieved by increasing the subtraction beam splitter interaction\ntransmissivity.

In fact, these proofs are simpler and give stronger results than\nprevious proofs for the classical model of computation.

Standard quantum mechanics\npredicts that, when Alice makes a few measurements, a large transverse\ncomponent of the spin angular momentum may appear in Bob's laboratory. A\nparadox then arises since local angular momentum conservation seems to be\nviolated. It has been suggested that this angular momentum may be provided by\nthe interaction with the measurement apparatuses. We show that this solution of\nthe paradox is not appropriate, so that another explanation must be sought. The\ngeneral question is the retroaction of a quantum system onto a measurement\napparatus. For instance, when the measured system is entangled with another\nquantum system, can its reaction on a measurement apparatus be completely\nchanged? Is angular momentum conserved only on average over several\nmeasurements, but not during one realization of the experiment?",

Interactions can have\nprofound effects and lead to entirely new insulating phases, with an altogether\nmuch richer and less explored phenomenology, as is particularly clear in the\ncase of partial filling of weakly dispersive bands. Most saliently, lattice\ngeneralizations of fractional quantum Hall states, dubbed fractional Chern\ninsulators, have recently been predicted to be stabilized by interactions\nwithin nearly dispersionless bands with non-zero Chern number, $C$. Contrary to\ntheir continuum analogues, these states do not require an external magnetic\nfield and may potentially persist at high temperatures, which make these\nsystems very interesting in the context of applications such as topological\nquantum computation. This review recapitulates the basics of tight-binding\nmodels hosting nearly flat bands with non-trivial topology, $C\\neq 0$, and\nsummarizes the present understanding of interactions and strongly correlated\nphases within these bands. Emphasis is put on the analogy with continuum Landau\nlevel physics, as well as qualitatively new, lattice specific, aspects\nincluding Berry curvature fluctuations, competing instabilities as well as\nnovel collective states of matter emerging in bands with $|C|>1$.

Using laser-assisted tunneling in a tilted optical\npotential we engineer spatially dependent complex tunneling amplitudes. Thereby\natoms hopping in the lattice accumulate a phase shift equivalent to the\nAharonov-Bohm phase of charged particles in a magnetic field. We determine the\nlocal distribution of fluxes through the observation of cyclotron orbits of the\natoms on lattice plaquettes, showing that the system is described by the\nHofstadter model. Furthermore, we show that for two atomic spin states with\nopposite magnetic moments, our system naturally realizes the time-reversal\nsymmetric Hamiltonian underlying the quantum spin Hall effect, i.e., two\ndifferent spin components experience opposite directions of the magnetic field.",
