    "abstract": "Wigner crystals can manifest discrete solitons, that are nonlinear,\ntopologically-protected configurations of the crystal. Such solitons typically\ninherit from continuum solitons the ability to move around the crystal, and\ntheir discreteness leads to the existence of an internal mode: a gap-separated,\nspatially-localized collective motional mode of oscillation. We suggest that\nsuch unique properties of discrete solitons (kinks), can be utilized for the\npurpose of generating entanglement between different sites of the crystal. We\nstudy a detailed proposal in the context of state-of-the-art methods and\nexperiments with trapped ions, and find that a single soliton can be used to\nproduce GHZ and EPR states with high fidelity. The realization of our method\nrequires Doppler cooling of the crystal, and sideband cooling only of the\nkink's internal mode. Since the gap separation of the latter is nearly\nindependent of the crystal's size, the proposed approach could be particularly\nhelpful for producing entanglement and studying system-environment interactions\nin rather large systems.\n",

With a decrease of $\\cos\\theta$ by tuning the control field, the\neffective cavity decay rate $\\kappa^{^{\\prime}}$ decreases, thus the effect of\ntuning the control field is equivalent to that of increasing the quality\nfactors $Q$. Owing to this especial feature, this system behaves very strong\nsingle-photon nonlinearities, and the nonlinear strength would be more than\nthree orders of magnitude larger than both the effective cavity decay rate and\natomic decay rate. We also show the application of the strong nonlinearities to\nstrong photon blockade, which has been exploited as a powerful tool for quantum\ncontrol of light quanta.\n",

    "abstract": "We introduce and discuss a set of tunable two-mode states of\ncontinuous-variable systems, as well as an efficient scheme for their\nexperimental generation. This novel class of tunable entangled resources is\ndefined by a general ansatz depending on two experimentally adjustable\nparameters. It is very ample and flexible as it encompasses Gaussian as well as\nnon-Gaussian states. The latter include, among others, known states such as\nsqueezed number states and de-Gaussified photon-added and photon-subtracted\nsqueezed states, the latter being the most efficient non-Gaussian resources\ncurrently available in the laboratory. Moreover, it contains the classes of\nsqueezed Bell states and even more general non-Gaussian resources that can be\noptimized according to the specific quantum technological task that needs to be\nrealized. The proposed experimental scheme exploits linear optical operations\nand photon detections performed on a pair of uncorrelated two--mode Gaussian\nsqueezed states. The desired non-Gaussian state is then realized via ancillary\nsqueezing and conditioning. Two independent, freely tunable experimental\nparameters can be exploited to generate different states and to optimize the\nperformance in implementing a given quantum protocol. As a concrete instance,\nwe analyze in detail the performance of different states considered as\nresources for the realization of quantum teleportation in realistic conditions.\nFor the fidelity of teleportation of an unknown coherent state, we show that\nthe resources associated to the optimized parameters outperform, in a\nsignificant range of experimental values, both Gaussian twin beams and\nphoton-subtracted squeezed states.",

The realization of such a\ndetector has been complicated by the fact that photon- photon interactions are\nvery weak at optical frequencies. At microwave frequencies, very strong\nphoton-photon interactions have been demonstrated. Here however, the\nsingle-photon detector has been elusive due to the low energy of the microwave\nphoton. In this article, we present a realistic proposal for quantum\nnondemolition measurements of a single propagating microwave photon. The\ndetector design is built on a of chain of artificial atoms connected through\ncirculators which break time-reversal symmetry, making both signal and probe\nphotons propagate in one direction only.

In the usual\nstationary coordinates $(t,x)$, one can describe the asymptotic evolution of\nthe wave-packets in WKB, but this WKB approximation breaks down in the vicinity\nof the horizon, thereby allowing for a mixing between initial and final\ncreation and annihilation operators. Thus, one might be tempted to identify\nthis point where WKB breaks down with the moment of particle creation. However,\nusing different coordinates $(\\tau,U)$, we find that one can evolve the waves\nso that WKB in these coordinates is valid throughout this transition region --\nwhich contradicts the above identification of the breakdown of WKB as the cause\nof the radiation. Instead, our analysis suggests that the tearing apart of the\nwaves into two different asymptotic regions (inside and outside the horizon) is\nthe major ingredient of Hawking radiation.",

Moreover, we want to emphasise the role\nthat quadratic forms can play in the description of quantum systems. A\ncharacterisation of the self-adjoint extensions of the Laplace-Beltrami\noperator in terms of unitary operators acting on the Hilbert space at the\nboundary is given. Using this description we are able to characterise a wide\nclass of self-adjoint extensions that go beyond the usual ones, i.e. Dirichlet,\nNeumann, Robin,.. and that are semi-bounded below. A numerical scheme to\ncompute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors in any dimension is proposed and its\nconvergence is proved. The role of invariance under the action of symmetry\ngroups is analysed in the general context of the theory of self-adjoint\nextensions of symmetric operators and in the context of closed quadratic forms.\nThe self-adjoint extensions possessing the same invariance than the symmetric\noperator that they extend are characterised in the most abstract setting.

In sharp contrast with\nclassical theory of electrodynamics, AB effect qualifies potential as a\nphysical reality, rather than as a mere mathematical tool, because the\ninterference is affected by a potential even when a charged particle moves in a\nfield-free region. Aharonov-Casher (AC) effect [3], dual to the AB phenomenon,\nshows a phase shift of a fluxon moving around a charge (in two-dimensional\ncase). It has been shown that AC effect is also free of force [4,5], but\nstandard view draws a clear distinction between the two phenomena in that the\nfluxon moves under a nonvanishing field generated by the charge in the case of\nAC effect [6]. Despite the fact that the observable phenomena depend only on\nthe relative motion of a charge and a fluxon, a unified picture, fully\nconsistent with the principle of relativity, is lacking. Here, we provide a\nunified theory which resolves the question of relativity, based on a\nLorentz-invariant field-interaction between a charge and a localized flux. The\nAB effect can be understood in this fully relativistic viewpoint. The AB phase\nshift is derived from the Lorentz-covariant interaction Lagrangian, and the\nforce-free nature of the effect is also confirmed.",

We begin by completing the \\emph{perfect}\ndistinguishability problem of two-qubit ensembles - both for separable\noperations and LOCC - by providing necessary and sufficient conditions for the\nperfect discrimination of one pure and one mixed state. Then for the well-known\ntask of minimum error discrimination, it is shown that \\textit{almost all}\ntwo-qubit ensembles consisting of three pure states cannot be optimally\ndiscriminated using LOCC. This is surprising considering that \\textit{any} two\npure states can be distinguished optimally by LOCC. Special attention is given\nto ensembles that lack entanglement, and we prove an easy sufficient condition\nfor when a set of three product states cannot be optimally distinguished by\nLOCC, thus providing new examples of the phenomenon known as \"non-locality\nwithout entanglement\". We next consider an example of $N$ parties who each\nshare the same state but who are ignorant of its identity. The state is drawn\nfrom the rotationally invariant \"trine ensemble\", and we establish a tight\nconnection between the $N$-copy ensemble and Shor's \"lifted\" single-copy\nensemble. For any finite $N$, we prove that optimal identification of the\nstates cannot be achieved by LOCC; however as $N\\to\\infty$, LOCC can indeed\ndiscriminate the states optimally. This is the first result of its kind.\nFinally, we turn to the task of unambiguous discrimination and derive new lower\nbounds on the LOCC inconclusive probability for symmetric states. When applied\nto the double trine ensemble, this leads to a rather different\ndistinguishability character than when the minimum-error probability is\nconsidered.",

    "abstract": "To acquire knowledge about nature we need to observe its constituents. In\nquantum mechanics, observing is not a passive act. Consider a system of two\nquantum particles A and B: if a measurement apparatus M is used to make an\nobservation on particle B, then the overall state of the system AB will\ntypically be altered. When this happens no matter which local measurement is\nperformed, the two objects A and B are revealed to possess peculiar\ncorrelations known as quantum discord. Here we demonstrate that the very act of\nlocal observation gives rise to an \"activation protocol\" which converts discord\ninto distillable entanglement, a stronger and more useful form of quantum\ncorrelations, between the apparatus M and the composite system AB. In order to\nexperimentally implement such activation protocol, we adopt a flexible\ntwo-photon setup to realize a three-qubit system (A,B,M) with programmable\ndegrees of initial correlations, measurement interaction, and characterization\nprocesses. Our experiment demonstrates the fundamental mechanism underpinning\nthe ubiquitous act of observing the quantum world, and unlocks the potential of\ndiscord for entanglement generation, a primitive for quantum technology.",

    "abstract": "The complementarity of two observables is often captured in uncertainty\nrelations, which quantify an inevitable tradeoff in knowledge. Here we study\ncomplementarity in the context of an information processing task: we link the\ncomplementarity of two observables to their usefulness for superdense coding\n(SDC). In SDC, Alice sends two classical dits of information to Bob by sending\na single qudit. While it is well known that preshared entanglement is necessary\nto achieve a quantum advantage in SDC (i.e., to send more than one dit per\nqudit), we find that complementarity is also necessary in the sense that the\nlocal unitaries Alice applies to her system must be non-commuting. Our main\nresult shows that complementarity is also \\textit{sufficient} to achieve a\nquantum advantage, when the preshared state is maximally entangled. More\nprecisely, when Alice encodes her messages with products of Pauli operators for\nobservables with non-zero complementarity then she can send Bob greater than\none dit per qudit, and if the observables have nearly perfect complementarity\nthen she can send nearly two dits per qudit. Our bound on the SDC capacity has\na striking resemblance to uncertainty relations, and we also generalise our\n\"uncertainty relation\" to the case where the channel from Alice to Bob is\nnoisy, and the preshared state is arbitrary. Our results shed light on the role\nof complementarity in determining the quantum advantage in SDC.",

    "abstract": "This paper considers right-invariant and controllable driftless quantum\nsystems with state X(t) evolving on the unitary group U(n) and m inputs. The\nT-sampling stabilization problem is introduced and solved: given any initial\ncondition X(0) any goal state Xg find a feedback law such that X(jT) converges\nto Xg as the integer j tends to infinity. The purpose is to generate arbitrary\nquantum gates corresponding to Xg. This is achieved by the tracking of\nT-periodic reference trajectories that pass by Xg using the framework of\nCoron's Return Method. The T-periodic reference trajectories are generated by\napplying open-loop controls that are a sum of a finite number M of odd\nT-periodic function whose amplitudes are parameterized by a vector. The main\nresult establishes that, for M big enough, X(jT) exponentially converges\ntowards Xg for almost all fixed amplitude vectors, with explicit and completely\nconstructive control laws. This paper also establishes a stochastic version of\nthis deterministic control law. The key idea is to randomly choose a different\namplitude vector at each sampling time jT, and keeping it fixed until the next\nsampling time (j+1)T. It is also shown that X(jT) exponentially converges\ntowards Xg almost surely. Simulation results have indicated that the\nconvergence speed may be significantly improved with such stochastic technique.\nThis is illustrated in the generation of the C--NOT quantum logic gate on U(4).",
