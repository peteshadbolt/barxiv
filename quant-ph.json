For strongly correlated\nsystems the SDP approach requires us to reassess the accuracy of the\nHartree-Fock energies and densities from standard software packages for\nelectronic structure theory. Calculations of the H$_{4}$ dimer and N$_{2}$\nmolecule show that the energies from SDP Hartree-Fock are lower than those from\nstandard Hartree-Fock methods by 100-200 kcal/mol in the dissociation region.\nThe present findings have important consequences for the computation and\ninterpretation of electron correlation, which is typically defined relative to\nthe Hartree-Fock energy and density.",

For any of these inequalities, satisfaction is equivalent\nto a joint probability distribution for all observables in the experiment. This\nimplies a joint distribution for all pairs of observables, and is indifferent\nto whether or not they commute in the theory. This indifference underpins a\nunification of the above inequalities into a general framework of correlation\ninequalities. When the physical scenario is such that the correlated pairs are\nall compatible, the resulting correlation is non-signaling, which may be local\nor multi-particle, corresponding to contextuality or Bell-type inequalities. If\nthe pairs are incompatible, the resulting correlation corresponds to LG\ninequalities. That quantum mechanics (QM) violates all these inequalities\nsuggests a close connection between the local, spatial and temporal properties\nof the theory. As a concrete manifestation of the unification, we extend the\nRoy-Singh method to derive and study a new class of hybrid spatio-temporal\ninequalities, where the correlated pairs in the experiment are both compatible\nor incompatible.

Moreover, we suggest a corrected\ntime-dependent density matrix renormalization group algorithm that ensures the\nconservation of the expectation value of the number of particles when a GVW or\na MPS are not explicitly number-conserving. The GVW dynamics obtained with our\nalgorithm compares very well with the exact one in 1D. Most importantly, the\nalgorithm works in any dimension for a GVW.

    "abstract": "Several logical qubits and quantum gates have been proposed for semiconductor\nquantum dots controlled by voltages applied to top gates. Differences between\nthe schemes can make it difficult to compare them meaningfully. Here we develop\na theoretical framework to evaluate disparate qubit-gating schemes on an equal\nfooting. We apply the procedure to two types of double-dot qubits: the\nsinglet-triplet (ST) and the semiconducting quantum dot hybrid qubit. We\ninvestigate three quantum gates that flip the qubit state: a DC pulsed gate, an\nAC gate based on logical qubit resonance (LQR), and a gate-like process known\nas stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP). These gates are all mediated by\nan exchange interaction that depends on a small number of experimental control\nparameters, including the interdot tunnel coupling $g$ and the detuning\n$\\epsilon$, which sets the energy difference between the dots. Our procedure\nhas two steps. First, we optimize the gate fidelity ($f$) for fixed $g$ as a\nfunction of the other control parameters; this yields an $f^\\text{opt}(g)$ that\nis universal for different types of gates. Next, we identify physical\nconstraints on the control parameters; this yields an upper bound\n$f^\\text{max}$ that is specific to the qubit-gate combination. We show that\nsimilar gate fidelities ($\\sim 99.5$%) should be attainable for ST qubits in\nisotopically purified Si, and for hybrid qubits in natural Si. Considerably\nlower fidelities are obtained for GaAs devices, due to the fluctuating magnetic\nfields $\\Delta B$ produced by nuclear spins.",

    "abstract": "Quantum information processing offers dramatic speedups, yet is famously\nsusceptible to decoherence, the process whereby quantum superpositions decay\ninto mutually exclusive classical alternatives, thus robbing quantum computers\nof their power. This has made the development of quantum error correction an\nessential and inescapable aspect of both theoretical and experimental quantum\ncomputing. So far little is known about protection against decoherence in the\ncontext of quantum annealing, a computational paradigm which aims to exploit\nground state quantum dynamics to solve optimization problems more rapidly than\nis possible classically. Here we develop error correction for quantum annealing\nand provide an experimental demonstration using up to 344 superconducting flux\nqubits in processors which have recently been shown to physically implement\nprogrammable quantum annealing. We demonstrate a substantial improvement over\nthe performance of the processors in the absence of error correction. These\nresults pave a path toward large scale noise-protected adiabatic quantum\noptimization devices.",

    "abstract": "It is widely accepted in the quantum cryptography community that interactive\ninformation reconciliation protocols, such as cascade, are ineffcient due to\nthe communication overhead. Instead, non-interactive information reconciliation\nprotocols based on i.e. LDPC codes or, more recently, polar codes have been\nproposed. In this work, we argue that interactive protocols should be taken\ninto consideration in modern quantum key distribution systems. In particular,\nwe demonstrate how to improve the performance of cascade by proper\nimplementation and use. Our implementation of cascade reaches a throughput\nabove 80 Mbps under realistic conditions. This is more than four times the\nthroughput previously demonstrated in any information reconciliation protocol.",

    "abstract": "It is well-known that Bell's Theorem and other No Hidden Variable theorems\nhave a \"retrocausal loophole\", because they assume that the values of\npre-existing hidden variables are independent of future measurement settings.\n(This is often referred to, misleadingly, as the assumption of \"free will\".)\nHowever, it seems to have gone unnoticed until recently that a violation of\nthis assumption is a straightforward consequence of time-symmetry, given an\nunderstanding of the quantization of light that would have seemed natural to\nEinstein after 1905. The new argument shows precisely why quantization makes a\ndifference, and why time-symmetry alone does not imply retrocausality, in the\nclassical context. It is true that later developments in quantum theory provide\na way to avoid retrocausality, without violating time-symmetry; but this escape\nroute relies on the \"ontic\" conception of the wave function that Einstein\nrejected. Had this new argument been noticed much sooner, then, it seems likely\nthat retrocausality would have been regarded as the default option for hidden\nvariables theories (a fact that would then have seemed confirmed by Bell's\nTheorem and the No Hidden Variable theorems).

We propose a general approach based on\nnon-Markovian dynamical maps to extract this information from the initial\ntrajectories and compress it into non-Markovian transfer tensors. Assuming\ntime-translational invariance, the tensors can be used to accurately and\nefficiently propagate the state of the system to arbitrarily long timescales.\nThe non-Markovian Transfer Tensor Method (TTM) demonstrates the\ncoherent-to-incoherent transition as a function of the strength of quantum\ndissipation and predicts the non-canonical equilibrium distribution due to the\nsystem-bath entanglement. TTM is equivalent to solving the Nakajima-Zwanzig\nequation, and therefore can be used to reconstruct the dynamical operators (the\nsystem Hamiltonian and memory kernel) from quantum trajectories obtained in\nsimulations or experiments. The concept underlying the approach can be\ngeneralized to physical observables with the goal of learning and manipulating\nthe trajectories of an open quantum system.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the scaling of the entanglement spectrum and of the R\\'enyi\nblock entropies and determine its universal aspects in the ground state of\ncritical and noncritical one-dimensional quantum spin models. In all cases, the\nscaling exhibits an oscillatory behavior that terminates at the factorization\npoint and whose frequency is universal. Parity effects in the scaling of the\nR\\'enyi entropies for gapless models at zero field are thus shown to be a\nparticular case of such universal behavior. Likewise, the absence of\noscillations for the Ising chain in transverse field is due to the vanishing\nvalue of the factorizing field for this particular model. In general, the\ntransition occurring at the factorizing field between two different scaling\nregimes of the entanglement spectrum corresponds to a quantum transition to the\nformation of finite-range, ordered structures of quasi-dimers, quasi-trimers,\nand quasi-polymers. This entanglement-driven transition is superimposed to and\nindependent of the long-range magnetic order in the broken symmetry phase.\nTherefore, it conforms to recent generalizations that identify and classify the\nquantum phases of matter according to the structure of ground-state\nentanglement patterns. We characterize this form of quantum order by a global\norder parameter of entanglement defined as the integral, over blocks of all\nlengths, of the R\\'enyi entropy of infinite order. Equivalently, it can be\ndefined as the integral of the bipartite single-copy or geometric entanglement.\nThe global entanglement order parameter remains always finite at fields below\nthe factorization point and vanishes identically above it.",
