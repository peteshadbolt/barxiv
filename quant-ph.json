    "abstract": "The two-way continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) systems\nallow higher key rates and improved transmission distances over standard\ntelecommunication networks in comparison to the one-way CVQKD protocols. To\nexploit the real potential of two-way CVQKD systems a robust reconciliation\ntechnique is needed. It is currently unavailable, which makes it impossible to\nreach the real performance of a two-way CVQKD system. The reconciliation\nprocess of correlated Gaussian variables is a complex problem that requires\neither tomography in the physical layer that is intractable in a practical\nscenario, or high-cost calculations in the multidimensional spherical space\nwith strict dimensional limitations. To avoid these issues, we propose an\nefficient logical layer-based reconciliation method for two-way CVQKD to\nextract binary information from correlated Gaussian variables. We demonstrate\nthat by operating on the raw-data level, the noise of the quantum channel can\nbe corrected in the scalar space and the reconciliation can be extended to\narbitrary high dimensions. We prove that the error probability of scalar\nreconciliation is zero in any practical CVQKD scenario, and provides\nunconditional security. The results allow to significantly improve the\ncurrently available key rates and transmission distances of two-way CVQKD. The\nproposed scalar reconciliation can also be applied in one-way systems as well,\nto replace the existing reconciliation schemes.\n",

These ambiguities are associated to choices of an integration\ncontour in the resummation of perturbation theory, along (singular) Stokes\ndirections in the complex Borel plane (rendering perturbative expansions\nnon-Borel summable along any Stokes line). More recently, it has been shown\nthat the proper framework to address these issues is that of resurgent analysis\nand transseries. In this context, the cancelation of all nonperturbative\nambiguities is shown to be a consequence of choosing the transseries median\nresummation as the appropriate family of unambiguous real solutions along the\ncoupling-constant real axis. While the median resummation is easily implemented\nfor one-parameter transseries, once one considers more general multi-parameter\ntransseries the procedure becomes highly dependent upon properly understanding\nStokes transitions in the complex Borel plane.

The evolution of a wave function with $N$\ntime variables is governed by $N$ Schr\\\"odinger equations, one for each time\nvariable. These Schr\\\"odinger equations can be inconsistent with each other,\ni.e., they can fail to possess a joint solution for every initial condition; in\nfact, the $N$ Hamiltonians need to satisfy a certain commutator condition in\norder to be consistent. While this condition is automatically satisfied for\nnon-interacting particles, it is a challenge to set up consistent multi-time\nequations with interaction. We prove for a wide class of multi-time\nSchr\\\"odinger equations that the presence of interaction potentials leads to\ninconsistency.

At\n25 mK, the first qubit had an energy relaxation time T1 that varied from 30 us\nto 200 us between 4 and 8 GHz and displayed an inverse correlation between T1\nand the coupling to the microwave drive line. The Ramsey fringe decay times T2*\nwere in the 200-500 ns range while the spin echo envelope decay times Techo\nvaried from 2.4-3.3 us, consistent with 1/f charge noise with a high frequency\ncutoff of 0.2 MHz. A second Cooper-pair box qubit with similar parameters\nshowed T1=4-30 us between 4-7.3 GHz, and that the T1 and the coupling were\nagain inversely correlated. Although the lifetime of the second device was\nshorter than that of the first device, the dependence on coupling in both\ndevices suggests that further reduction in coupling should lead to improved\nqubit performance.",

We find that the well-known method for locally increasing\nentanglement, phonon subtraction, may not result in entanglement gain when\nlosses are taken into account. Thus, we investigate the critical number m_c of\nphonon subtraction attempts from the matter modes of the quantum memory. If the\ninitial state is not de-Gaussified within m_c attempts, the protocol should be\nrestarted to obtain any entanglement increase. Moreover, the condition m_c>1\nimplies an additional constraint on the subtraction beam splitter interaction\ntransmissivity, viz. it should be about 50% for a wide range of protocol\nparameters. Additionally, we consider the average entanglement rate, which\ntakes into account both the unavoidable probabilistic nature of the protocol\nand its possible failure as a result of a large number of unsuccessful\nsubtraction attempts. We find that a higher value of the average entanglement\ncan be achieved by increasing the subtraction beam splitter interaction\ntransmissivity.

In this paper we have shown that transition\nprobability from first diabatic potential to any other potential can be easily\nevaluated using a very simple analytical formula - which only require value of\neigenfunction of first uncoupled potential and value of Green's function of\nother uncoupled potential, at the crossing.",

    "abstract": "Topological insulators are accompanied by exotic edge states that are\nprotected by a bulk single-particle band gap once the filled bands are\ncharacterized by non-trivial topological invariants. Interactions can have\nprofound effects and lead to entirely new insulating phases, with an altogether\nmuch richer and less explored phenomenology, as is particularly clear in the\ncase of partial filling of weakly dispersive bands. Most saliently, lattice\ngeneralizations of fractional quantum Hall states, dubbed fractional Chern\ninsulators, have recently been predicted to be stabilized by interactions\nwithin nearly dispersionless bands with non-zero Chern number, $C$. Contrary to\ntheir continuum analogues, these states do not require an external magnetic\nfield and may potentially persist at high temperatures, which make these\nsystems very interesting in the context of applications such as topological\nquantum computation. This review recapitulates the basics of tight-binding\nmodels hosting nearly flat bands with non-trivial topology, $C\\neq 0$, and\nsummarizes the present understanding of interactions and strongly correlated\nphases within these bands. Emphasis is put on the analogy with continuum Landau\nlevel physics, as well as qualitatively new, lattice specific, aspects\nincluding Berry curvature fluctuations, competing instabilities as well as\nnovel collective states of matter emerging in bands with $|C|>1$.

As a kind of quantum correlation, it is expected that\nbipartite nonlocaity should be present in quantum systems, just as bipartite\nentanglement does. Surprisingly, for various models, two-qubit states do not\nviolate Bell inequalities, i.e., they are local. Recently, it is realized that\nthe results are related to the monogamy trade-off obeyed by bipartite Bell\ncorrelations, thus it is believed that for general translation invariant\nsystems, two-qubit states should not violate the Bell inequality(Oliveira, EPL\n100, 60004 (2012)). In this report, we will demonstrate that in perfect\ntranslation invariant systems, the Bell inequality can be violated. A\nnontrivial model is constructed to confirm the conclusion.",

We apply the procedure to two types of double-dot qubits: the\nsinglet-triplet (ST) and the semiconducting quantum dot hybrid qubit. We\ninvestigate three quantum gates that flip the qubit state: a DC pulsed gate, an\nAC gate based on logical qubit resonance (LQR), and a gate-like process known\nas stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP). These gates are all mediated by\nan exchange interaction that depends on a small number of experimental control\nparameters, including the interdot tunnel coupling $g$ and the detuning\n$\\epsilon$, which sets the energy difference between the dots. Our procedure\nhas two steps. First, we optimize the gate fidelity ($f$) for fixed $g$ as a\nfunction of the other control parameters; this yields an $f^\\text{opt}(g)$ that\nis universal for different types of gates. Next, we identify physical\nconstraints on the control parameters; this yields an upper bound\n$f^\\text{max}$ that is specific to the qubit-gate combination. We show that\nsimilar gate fidelities ($\\sim 99.5$%) should be attainable for ST qubits in\nisotopically purified Si, and for hybrid qubits in natural Si.

Spontaneous parametric down-conversion is the mainstay\nfor single-photon state preparation, the technique employed in most optical\nquantum information processing implementations to-date. Here we present a\nsimple architecture for boson-sampling based on multiplexed parameteric\ndown-conversion and demonstrate that the architecture is limited only by the\npost-selected detection efficiency. That is, given that detection efficiencies\nare sufficiently high to enable post-selection, photon-number errors in the\ndown-converters are sufficiently low as to guarantee correct boson-sampling\nmost of the time. Thus, we show that parametric down-conversion sources will\nnot present a bottleneck for future boson-sampling implementations. Rather,\nphotodetection efficiency is the limiting factor and thus future\nimplementations may continue to employ down-conversion sources.",

So far little is known about protection against decoherence in the\ncontext of quantum annealing, a computational paradigm which aims to exploit\nground state quantum dynamics to solve optimization problems more rapidly than\nis possible classically. Here we develop error correction for quantum annealing\nand provide an experimental demonstration using up to 344 superconducting flux\nqubits in processors which have recently been shown to physically implement\nprogrammable quantum annealing.
