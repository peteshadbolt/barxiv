    "abstract": "Gradientless light fields are shown to exert pulling forces on arbitrary objects in purely passive dielectric media. These forces arise from amplification of the photon linear momentum when light is scattered from one dielectric to another with a higher refractive index. They can manipulate objects over macroscopic distances along dielectric interfaces.",

The laser's phase and field-strength characteristics are directly imprinted onto the magnetization response. The off-resonant magnetization removes the speed limitation caused by the cooling process, providing new opportunities for ultrafast data storage.",
