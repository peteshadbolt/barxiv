    "abstract": "Ataxia telangiectasia is a genetic disease that results in various pathological disorders. In this study, the authors develop an in vitro model of Ataxia telangiectasia using human induced pluripotent stem cells, and find that physiological defects can be alleviated by small molecule read-through compounds.",
